#### App for artists/creators to record information about their projects. 
#### 03/01/2019


#### By Katrina Hockman

## Description

### MVP: 
* App Homepage with about info, login page
* User page to add/view/edit projects
* Separate forms for each category type (painting, sculpture, other) 
* Pricing suggestion based on materials cost per piece, time spent on project, set base price, etc
* Finished project portfolio view (May be moved to additional features)

### Tools:
 React and Redux will be used. I am looking for an API from a supplies brand or store that could be integrated into a search option in the project form. 

### Additional Features:
• More categories & forms (Photography, crafts, video, performance, etc)
• Mobile app option to take pictures of receipts, scan QR codes/ barcodes of products
• Connect with other users for collaborations, etc.
• Recording buyer information/ selling platforms

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
